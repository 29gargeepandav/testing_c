Polymorphysm

multiple behariour in 
polymorphys is greek word.

types of polymorphism
1. Compile time polimorphysm.
--> method over loading
--> operotor overloded.(binary & unary operator)

2. Run time polymorphism
--> operator overriding


Diffent betweens mathod overloding and method overridning

* method overloading :

[	
	-single class, multiple methods
	- method name must be same, but parameters are different,
	-prameters datatype can be differnet with same number of parameter quantity
]


--> its provides multiple definations of the method by changing signature(defination).
--> method signature should be different
--> overloaded methods are same scope
--> it is used when the same function has to be behave differntly depending upon parameters passed to them.
--> a method has ability to load multiple times.
--> in method overloading we dont need inheritance


* method overriding :
(overrriding means replacing value)
[
	- multiple class, multiple methods
	- method name must be same, but parameters must be same
	- inheritance is requried
]

--> it is redefination of baseclass function in its derived class with same class 
--> method signature should be the same.
--> overloaded methods are in different scopes. 
--> it is needed when derived class function has to do some different job than base class function.
--> method can be overrriden only a single time
--> in methodoverriding we need inheritance
